# Software-Principle

# DRY and WET (Dry Wet Coding) and (We Enjoy Typing)

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): This principle aims to prevent the repetition of the same code. Reuse of code snippets with the same or similar functionality in the code base is encouraged. For this purpose, common code fragments can be abstracted as functions or classes and made reusable.

We Enjoy Typing (WET): This principle focuses on the writing process to make the code more readable and understandable. It refers to approaches that tend to write more code instead of repetitive pieces of code. This can often lead to longer or more complex codes. Dry Wet Coding aims to balance these two principles. Developers try to create a more effective code base by reusing the code and at the same time making efforts for readability and intelligibility. Well-written and edited codes are created to ensure intelligibility and ease of maintenance, while eliminating code repetitions.

These principles can help to ensure a better code quality, sustainability, ease of debugging and overall efficiency in the software development process.

# SOC(Seperation Of Concerns)

Separation of Concerns (Enthusiasm Separation) is a principle used in the field of software engineering. This principle is based on the principle of separation of different responsibilities (concern) and independence in the design of a software system. It means that each responsibility should be focused in its own field and developed independently of other responsibilities.

Separation of Concerns provides the following advantages in the design and development process of software systems:

- Modularity: Each responsibility can be divided into a module or component. This modular structure makes it easier to make changes to the system, isolate problems, and allow the development team to work in parallel.
- Sustainability: Treating each responsibility separately makes the code cleaner, more organized and sustainable.Jul. The isolation of problems and a clear definition of responsibilities facilitate the maintenance and debugging processes.
- Reusability: The independent development of each responsibility facilitates the reuse of these responsibilities in other projects or in different contexts. The modular structure increases the interchangeability and reusability of components.
- Testability: Responsibilities can be tested separately, so that the accuracy and functionality of each responsibility can be checked more easily. This also improves the quality of the software. Separation of Concerns is an important principle for managing the complexity of a system, improving the quality of code and making the software development process more efficient.

# SRP(Single Responsibility Principle)

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the principles of software engineering. The SRP states that each class or module should have only one responsibility. This principle means that a class should require a change of only one reason.

SRP provides the following advantages:

More sustainable code: Having only one responsibility for a class or module makes the code cleaner, more readable Jul more sustainable. The separation of responsibilities makes it easier to better organize and understand the complex codebase.
- Isolation of changes: Since each responsibility is included in a separate class or module, the impact of one responsibility on other responsibilities is minimized in cases of change or error. This prevents the changes from spreading to other parts and simplifies the maintenance process.
- Parallel development: Each class or module can be developed independently. This allows team members to work in different responsibilities and move forward in parallel. At the same time, the fact that the changes have a limited area of impact makes it easier to carry out parallel development in a harmonious way. SRP is a principle that allows software to be more modular, sustainable, testable and generally better quality. The fact that each class or module focuses only on a specific responsibility keeps the growth of the code base under control and provides flexibility to adapt to future changes.
